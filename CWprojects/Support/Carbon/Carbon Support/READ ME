ð CarbonLib 1.6 CarbonSupport folderThe Carbon Support folder contains interfaces and libraries necessary to build for Carbon.  The Metrowerks CodeWarrior projects for the sample code provided with the CarbonLib Software Development Kit rely on this folder being placed in your "Metrowerks CodeWarrior" folder within your CodeWarrior development environment.  The CarbonLib extension OR the DebuggingCarbonLib extension, located within the Carbon Implementation Libraries folder, must be copied to your Extensions folder within your System Folder, and the machine restarted, before Carbon applications can be run.In addition, this folder contains "CarbonFrameworkLib", a stub library which exports the pertinent interfaces for Carbon on Mac OS X; the CarbonFrameworkLib stub reflects the delta of Carbon api implementation on the Mac OS 8/9 and Mac OS X platforms as of this release.Instructions on how to build the sample code can be found in the Carbon Porting Guide document in the  Documentation folder.Thank-you for your support.June 20, 2002
